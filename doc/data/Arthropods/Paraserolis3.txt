Ecology: Paraserolis polita is a predator and feeds on a variety of small invertebrates, particularly amphipods and polychaete worms. It lives for up to 6 years and reaches maturity after about 2, breeding every two years. Eggs are laid in autumn and brooded in a marsupium for a year and a half, and then the young are released in spring. This long incubation period is probably timed to coincide the release of juveniles with the most productive part of the Antarctic season.
