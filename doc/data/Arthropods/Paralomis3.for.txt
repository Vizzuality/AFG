Ecology: This is an edible crab and has been fished. Paralomis formosa has a commensal relationship with a small snailfish, which appears to attach to the crab by means of its sucker disc and remain closely associated with it throughout its lifetime. The crab suffers no discernable harm??# while the fish probably gains shelter and food scraps. # see Martin Collins#  !!! this is not true- rewrite snailfish bit.
