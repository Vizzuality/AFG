Description: large, orange and ten legged sea spider. One of the more common large sea spiders in the Scotia Arc and northern Antarctic Pensinsula region of Antarctic waters.  Most sea spiders across the globe are small, but the high oxygen levels of the cold and well-mixed Southern Ocean enable the largest species to be relative giants.  Decalopoda australis and the Collossendeis species are slow moving predators, which walk around in rich areas of benthos.  A sea spider seen on an octocoral was still in exactly the same place a week later!  D. australis climbs octocorals to eat the polyps and reduces the orange dangling Primnoella and Thourella stems to just the black skeletal rods underneath.  Unlike the Collossendeis species (which have 8 legs) D. australis has ten.
