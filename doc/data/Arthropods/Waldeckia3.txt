Ecology: Waldeckia obesa is a necrophage. It eats carrion, usually in a highly decomposed state. Although it lives in sub-tidal waters one of its predators is known to be the Antarctic tern (Sterna vittata). Possibly in this instance predation occurs when carcasses containing amphipods get washed ashore, bringing them within easy reach of the birds.
