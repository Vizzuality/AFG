Ecology: Heterophoxus videns is a voracious predator and eats animals at the sediment surface such as settling larvae, small or young worms, other crustaceans, sponges and diatoms. It and other predatory under-surface crustaceans probably play a major role in the composition and size of polychaete populations. Its predators include Trematomus fish.
