Ecology: L. convexum has been seen on a couple of occasions at South Georgia and once in the Antarctic Peninsula.  Although acorn barnacles are famously near absent from southern polar waters, stalked (goose) barnacles do occur but usually in deep water.  L. convexum is one of a number of similar species most of which are likely to be encountered as epibionts of other animals trawled up.
