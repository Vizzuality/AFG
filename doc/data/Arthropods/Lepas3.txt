Ecology: L. australis is the most common goosebarnacle in the subantarctic.  This species is most frequently encountered attached to flotsam such as logs, pumice, plastic buoys, or other artefacts.  The species also attaches to fur seals but is brushed off within a few days of them hauling out onto beaches (easiest seen in early November to late December).  L. australis, as all barnacles, is a suspension feeder eating phytoplankton. The main predators of L. australis are unknown, but probably birds.
