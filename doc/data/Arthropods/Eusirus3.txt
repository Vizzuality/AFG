Ecology: Eusirus perdentatus is a carnivorous predator with occasional scavenging behaviour. It mainly eats other small crustaceans and its diet also includes polychaete worms. It is preyed on by Trematomus fish.
Studies suggest that this animal only breeds once in its lifetime, and the juveniles hatch out at the end of the austral summer.
