= AFG

== Requirements

  - Ruby 1.8.7x (not working in 1.9.x)
  - Rails 3 beta
  - wkhtmltopdf

== Installation

First of all, install bundler:

    sudo gem install bundler
    
Then:

    bundle install
    
And finally, migrate the databases:

    rake db:migrate

=== Installing PDFKit and wkhtmltopdf

In order to generate pdf's it's necessary to install an external dependency from

http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/

Once you have installed the binary, create a symlink from it to /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf which is the path where Rails is gonna search the binary.

=== Example data

If you are in development mode and want some data:

    rake db:seed
    
=== Importing real data
    
Or you can import real data:

    rake afg:import_data


== Setting an admin password

By default, if you don't set a password for the administration, the defaults are:

    User: afg
    Password: afg
    
If you want to set a new password (the User can't be changed), visit:

   http://your.host/authorizations
   
And then, set the new password.
