Description:
    The migration generator creates a migration to add the activities table to your database and takes no arguments.

Example:
    rails generate acts_as_scribe_migration
	
	Migration:  db/migrate/<migration_number>_acts_as_scribe.rb
	The Activity model lives in the lib directory of this plugin. You can move that model into your models directory and modify it if you like.
